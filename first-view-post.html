                                There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX
                                upright rocket landing. Simple as it seems, the excitement, at
                                least for me, stems from how the feat has brought us one step
                                closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies – etched into our minds
                                by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced.
                                <br/><br/>
                                If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we
                                witnessed the
                                Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an
                                ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune
                                of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being
                                struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the
                                MAV ascended into space. Combine the thought of how the MAV got
                                there in the first place, and you have yourself a similar parallel
                                to the SpaceX launch and landing.
                                <br/><br/>
                                So what am I getting at? Science
                                fiction only remains science fiction until technology catches up
                                with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel, but
                                every other area of technological advancement.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <strong>Breakthroughs in the Living Room</strong>
                                <br/><br/>
                                Whether we realize it or not, spectacular scientific breakthroughs can
                                be found in the very heart of our homes. Let’s take TVs for example.
                                Ask your grandparents whether they’d have thought color TV was ever
                                possible in the age of black & white screens. In retrospect, many may
                                not have expressed such optimism.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Then there were the early 2000s when industry pioneers sold us the
                                idea of being able to spot every blade of grass on the football pitch
                                as the advent of high definition TV dawned upon us. Industry
                                naysayers expressed serious doubt as such a transition would have
                                required a major overhaul to equipment and broadcast standards.
                                <br/><br/>
