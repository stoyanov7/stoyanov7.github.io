                            <p>
                                There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX
                                upright rocket landing. Simple as it seems, the excitement, at
                                least for me, stems from how the feat has brought us one step
                                closer to fulfilling our sci-fi fantasies – etched into our minds
                                by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced.If you can
                                recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we witnessed the
                                Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an
                                ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune
                                of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being
                                struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the
                                MAV ascended into space. Combine the thought of how the MAV got
                                there in the first place, and you have yourself a similar parallel
                                to the SpaceX launch and landing.So what am I getting at? Science
                                fiction only remains science fiction until technology catches up
                                with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel, but
                                every other area of technological advancement.

                            </header>

                                <p>
                                    Much has been made of the impending move to a largely IP and
                                    hybrid cloud infrastructure in the media and entertainment
                                    industry and with good reason. Over the last decade the shift
                                    from SDI to IP has been met with both cheers and jeers.
                                    Supporters of transitioning to IP speak of vast operating and
                                    financial benefits, while traditional broadcast facilities
                                    and operators are still struggling to reconcile these
                                    potential gains with their unease over emerging standards and
                                    interoperability concerns.

                                    In an effort to assuage these concerns, EMC alongside several
                                    of the industry’s leading vendors such as Cisco, Evertz,
                                    Imagine Communications and Sony have joined the Alliance for
                                    IP Media Solutions (AIMS). AIMS, a non-profit trade alliance,
                                    is focused on helping broadcast and media companies move from
                                    bespoke legacy systems to a virtualized, IP-based future –
                                    quickly and economically. Believing open, standards-based
                                    protocol as critically important to ensuring long-term
                                    interoperability, AIMS’ promotes the adoption of several
                                    standards: VSF TR-03 and TR-04, SMPTE 2022-6 and AES67.
