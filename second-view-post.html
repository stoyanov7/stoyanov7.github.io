                                <h2>Taking AIMS at the IP Transition</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Much has been made of the impending move to a largely IP and
                                    hybrid cloud infrastructure in the media and entertainment
                                    industry and with good reason. Over the last decade the shift
                                    from SDI to IP has been met with both cheers and jeers.
                                    Supporters of transitioning to IP speak of vast operating and
                                    financial benefits, while traditional broadcast facilities
                                    and operators are still struggling to reconcile these
                                    potential gains with their unease over emerging standards and
                                    interoperability concerns.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    In an effort to assuage these concerns, EMC alongside several
                                    of the industry’s leading vendors such as Cisco, Evertz,
                                    Imagine Communications and Sony have joined the Alliance for
                                    IP Media Solutions (AIMS). AIMS, a non-profit trade alliance,
                                    is focused on helping broadcast and media companies move from
                                    bespoke legacy systems to a virtualized, IP-based future –
                                    quickly and economically. Believing open, standards-based
                                    protocol as critically important to ensuring long-term
                                    interoperability, AIMS’ promotes the adoption of several
                                    standards: VSF TR-03 and TR-04, SMPTE 2022-6 and AES67.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    It is important that organizations continue to advocate for AIMS’
                                    roadmap for open standards in IP technology and do their part to
                                    educate each other, which is why we recently partnered with TV
                                    Technology and Broadcast Television and internet production
                                    technology conceptEngineering to develop an e-book titled “The IP
                                    Transformation: What It Means for M&E Storage Strategies”. It
                                    examines how the combination of standard Ethernet/IP networking,
                                    virtualized workflows on commodity servers and clustered
                                    high-performance storage is influencing new video facility design
                                    and expanding new business opportunities for media companies. The
                                    e-book takes a closer look on topics such as media exchange
                                    characteristics, the eventual fate of Fibre Channel, Quality of
                                    Service (QoS) and storage needs for evolving media workflows.
